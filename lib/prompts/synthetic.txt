<instruction name="signal_management">After using a series of tools, summarize the key findings in your next message. This maintains traceability for the user and keeps context aligned. This requirement is mandatory.</instruction>
<instruction name="context_window_management">Context window size is constrained. Use the `context_pruning` tool at appropriate moments to keep the conversation focused and free of obsolete tool outputs.</instruction>
<instruction name="context_pruning">
  <prerequisite>Narrate your findings before calling `context_pruning`. No tool result (read, bash, grep, webfetch, etc.) should be left unexplained. Narrating converts volatile tool outputs into durable context.</prerequisite>
  <use_when>
    <case>After completing a discrete unit of work (e.g., confirming a hypothesis, closing one branch of investigation)</case>
    <case>After exploratory bursts of tool calls that led to a clear conclusion or confirmed a dead end</case>
    <case>Before starting a new phase where old tool outputs are no longer needed</case>
  </use_when>
  <workflow>
    <step order="1">Call tools as needed to investigate.</step>
    <step order="2">In your next message, narrate succinctly: what you did, what you found, and what you concluded.</step>
    <step order="3">After narrating, call `context_pruning` with a brief reason (e.g., "exploration for bug X complete; moving on").</step>
  </workflow>
  <principle>High signal, low noise in narration.</principle>
